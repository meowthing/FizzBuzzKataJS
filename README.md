# Testing with Jest in Typescript using ES6 Modules
A recipe for a headache.

##Â Learnings
- Use `ts-jest`
- Jest has *experimental* support for ESM. I'm not sure what this implies and I'm afraid to know.
- MAybe using Babel is easier on the mind as it should help transpile TS and ESM, but I'm sure the config is another rabbit hole to fall into.
